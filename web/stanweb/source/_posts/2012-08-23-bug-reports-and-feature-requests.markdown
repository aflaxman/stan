Found a bug? Want a feature Stan doesn't have yet? Here's how to report it to the team. 
<!-- more --> 

### Reporting Bugs
To report bugs, please use the Stan [Issue Tracker].
To make it as easy as possible for us to help you, please provide as much context as possible, including the version of RStan and R, C++ compiler version, and operating system (including bit size and memory).

### Requesting Features
To formally request a new feature for Stan, please also use the Stan [Issue Tracker].
Before requesting a feature, please browse the current list of feature requests on the most recent Stan  [to-do list](https://code.google.com/p/stan/source/browse/TO-DO.txt).

We informally discuss feature requests on both the user's and developer's [mailing lists](/mailing-lists/).
