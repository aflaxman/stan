Stan is open source because we want your feedback to help make Stan's code and documentation better.

## Contribute Code Patches
If you'd like to contribute a bug patch, please submit a Git patch or Git pull request either on the user's or developer's [mailing list] or through the issue tracker.

Contribute Models and Data
We're still discussing how to support user-contributed models. The issues to sort out are

1. how to vet the models to make sure they work,
1. how to handle intellectual property and licensing, and
1. how to store and distribute them.
If you have suggestions, let us know on the [mailing list].

## Join the Development Team

We're always on the lookout for new developers willing to get their hands dirty with C++ design, coding, documentation, testing, and maintenance.

The most up-to-date list of work is on the [to-do list](https://code.google.com/p/stan/source/browse/TO-DO.txt).
The current list of bugs and feature requests is available from the [issue tracker].

If you'd like to join the development team and get commit access to the Stan code repository, please let us know by first requesting to join the developer's mailing list.

Please include a brief description of your programming background and what you'd like to contribute.
